                The Ratty Utensil Dispenser provides a hygenic way for students to grab one time use utensils if they choose to take their food out to-go.
            </p>
            <h4> Part 2: Recording Observations</h4>
            <p>
                Observation: Most users grabbed a fork, knife, and occasionally a spoon. However some users grabbed multiple forks and knives at a time.
                Additionally, some users missed the mark the first time they tried to grab the utensil. 
            </p>
            <p> Interview Questions: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Which utensils do you grab? How many of each?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is it easy to use? What other forms do you prefer if any?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What problems have you encountered with the utensil dispenser?
                </li>
            </ol> 
            <p> Interview Results: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It seems that people who live off campus or have partial meal plans like to stock up on utensils by taking multiple at a time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Forks are the most common utensil taken.
                </li>
                <li> People like how hygenic it is and it is easy to see which utensil one is grabbing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4> Part 3: Personas</h4>
            <img src="Personas/persona.jpg" alt="User persona of Hoarding Hannah and Frustrated Faith">
            <p>Hoarding Hannah represents a utensil dispenser power user: since she was a freshman she would often get Ratty takeout and 
                now that she lives off campus she hoards utensils for when her friends are over since she doesn't own a lot of utensils.
                This persona faces the problem of dispenser being very loud therefore people around her notice and hear when she takes
                multiple at a time and she feels slightly embarrassed. She represents the users who understand how to use the interface
                but would like some improvements. 
            </p>
            <p> On the other hand, Frustrated Faith is a freshman that is not as familiar with the utensil dispenser. On the surface level,
                her problem with the interface is that since people use forks most often, it seems that the dispenser is always out of forks 
                or that the utensils often get stuck. However she does not know that there is a feature built into the tool that allows you
                to tell if there are forks left or if it is just stuck. She represents users who are general users and only know the basic 
                functionality. 
            </p>
